<h2> The Lessons</h2>
<br>
During and after the programme, I realised that exposure to new environments and the ability to push myself out of my own comfort zone was an incredibly rewarding (and not so terrifying) experience. Whether I succeed or not in being an effective leader in that instance, there is always a lesson to be learnt. Taking this lesson, I would be able to build and rectify my mistakes so that I can be a better leader the next time I put myself forward.
An important concept that I find myself applying in my everyday life since Hanoi is Common Purpose’s idea of “core and flex”. Being able to in the smallest everyday situations and in professional settings, to take a step back to analyse exactly what it is that is in my core and what I am willing to compromise/adjust my ideals on, has allowed me to firstly, know myself better as a person and project to others what my core values and strength are, but also to compromise in situations where a conflict may occur or where it may benefit the team.
</br>

<br>Furthermore, I am grateful to Common Purpose’s approach of teaching. As groups, we were able to work through all the problems/activities proactively without completely understanding the purpose but at the end through team work, we were always able to see the lesson (without being spoon fed).
</br>
<br>
Going forth, this trip despite being only a week long, has allowed me to grow as an individual and as a leader. Being aware of different cultures and experiencing new things at the same time enabled all the participants to connect on a more personal level.
</br>
<br>
I have also grown to see that day by day you are able to adjust to new settings a little more despite it being so foreign and stranger to what I am used to. Which has lead me to have the confidence to consider living, working or studying in a new city such as Hanoi. Having learnt so much from just one week, I can only imagine what I can achieve with a year or two!
</br>
<br>
I would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone from the trip, Common Purpose, City and of course, Aliya for giving me this fantastic opportunity to develop as a leader and allowing me to go on a wonderful adventure!
</br>

Thank you.
